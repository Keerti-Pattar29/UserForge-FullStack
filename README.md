UserForge-FullStack is a complete full-stack web application designed to simplify employee feedback and user management in an organization. Built using ReactJS for the frontend and Python Flask for the backend, this project offers a seamless and responsive user interface combined with powerful API-driven functionality. Users can perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), view data in a visually enhanced styled table, and manage feedback effectively. Key features include a search bar, filter by company or city, toast notifications (without external libraries), confirm delete dialogs, pagination, a dark/light theme toggle, and even CSV export functionality. This project also supports role-based access control for managers and employees, providing secure and scalable usage. With a mobile-responsive layout and modern animations, UserForge delivers a smooth and professional user experience for internal use cases like HR tools, feedback systems, or user dashboards.
